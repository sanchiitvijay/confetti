## System Architecture

The Confetti platform consists of three main components: the front-end, the back-end, and the database. The platform follows a client-server architecture, with the front-end serving as the client and the back-end and database serving as the server.

### Front-end

The front end of Confetti includes all the essential pages for a confession site. Some of these pages are:

- **Homepage**: This page displays a list of all confessions with links to other tabs.
- **Leaderboard**: This page shows real-time user statistics across the platform.
- **Notifications**: This page displays all notifications the user receives, with real-time implementation.
- **My Profile**: This page provides details about the user's account, including their name, email, and other relevant information, as well as website usage stats.
- **My Posts**: This page shows all the posts a user has made.
- **Settings**: This page allows the user to edit their account details.
- **404 Page**: This page informs the user that the requested route does not exist.

### Back-end

The back end of Confetti provides a range of features and functionalities, including:

- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Users can sign up and log in to the platform using their email addresses, passwords, and college details. The platform also supports OTP (One-Time Password) verification and forgot password functionality for added security.
- **Post Management**: Users can create, read, update, and delete posts.
- **Cloud-based Media Management**: Confetti uses Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management service, to store and manage all media content, including images, videos, and GIFs.
- **Markdown Formatting**: Post content can be formatted using Markdown, allowing for easier display and rendering on the front end.
- **Web Cache**: This feature stores the website’s cache to improve speed and performance using Redis.

### Database

The database of Confetti consists of:
- **MongoDB**: Used for saving user and post data.
- **Firebase store**: Used for saving real-time data.
